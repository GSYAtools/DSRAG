    "generated_answer": "Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), genetic data is classified as personal health data and is therefore considered sensitive, receiving enhanced protection. Controllers must establish a legal basis for processing this data, typically through explicit consent or public interest in public health. When this data crosses national borders, especially outside the EU, additional safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) are required. Transparency, accountability, and data minimization are emphasized as cornerstones of lawful processing. In the context of genomic research, informed consent must be granular, allowing individuals to accept or refuse specific types of data usage. Hospitals must adopt dynamic consent systems that inform participants of new risks and opportunities associated with their data. If the data is transferred internationally, risk assessments and supplementary measures like encryption or pseudonymization are recommended."
