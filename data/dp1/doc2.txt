Federated Data Access in Hospital Networks

Federated learning and data spaces have emerged as promising solutions to enable multi-institutional analysis without centralizing sensitive health records. In hospital consortia, federated models allow local computation on patient data, sharing only aggregated results. This preserves privacy while enabling collaboration. However, implementation remains complex due to heterogeneity in data schemas, varying legal requirements, and inconsistent anonymization standards.
